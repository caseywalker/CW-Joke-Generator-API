# Joke Generator
## Overview
Joke Generator will deliver a Joke from the Joke Generator API, we start with the setup and can click to see the punchline, and then get another joke from the API. I was especially fond of this project, because who doesn't love testing an API and getting numerous good jokes along the way? 

## Deployed App
[Joke Generator](https://cw-jokes.netlify.app/)

## User Description
